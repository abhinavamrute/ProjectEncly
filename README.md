# ProjectEncly — Anonymous & Uncensored Communication (Open Source)

**Encly** is an open-source, privacy-first social network and messaging platform built for those who refuse to be tracked, silenced, or surveilled. Built around anonymity, encryption, and freedom of speech, Encly gives users a safe space to express without identity or fear.

> Developed by an 18-year-old as a protest against censorship in India — Encly is not just an app, it's a digital rebellion.
